Rivertiler has been entirely rewritten. I've only left a few important layouts and other as demos. It is much easier to combine multiple layouts into one. I plan to document it eventually.

The layout generator is on the AUR under the name of `rivertiler-git`

`rivertiler center`

`rivertiler left`

`rivertiler dwindle`

`rivertiler nested`

`rivertiler magic`
